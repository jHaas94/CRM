# CRM
I've created a CRM programm with a connection to a database. I've implemented it by using PHP, Javascript, HTML and a CSS Framework (Bootstrap).

Features:
User-Registration
User-Login
Create new customers by adding them with a form
Showing a list of all customers
Possibility to change the data of customers
Logedin Users can see all the customers but are only allowed to delete customers if they where created by them
